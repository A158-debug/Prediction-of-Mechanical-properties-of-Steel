## Introduction

In many engineering applications, understanding the mechanical properties of materials is crucial for designing reliable and efficient structures. Traditional methods for predicting these properties can be time-consuming and expensive. This project explores the application of machine learning to predict mechanical properties, offering a more efficient and cost-effective approach.

## Features

- **Data-driven Predictions:** Utilizing a dataset containing information about material composition, processing conditions, and mechanical properties to train machine learning models.
  
- **Model Flexibility:** Implementing various machine learning algorithms to find the most suitable model for the given dataset.

- **Scalability:** Designing the system to accommodate new data easily and update models for continuous improvement.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/mechanical-properties-prediction.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Explore the codebase and review the documentation.

## Data

The dataset used for training and testing the models is located in the `data` directory. It contains information on material properties and other relevant features.

## Data Preprocessing

Before training the machine learning models, the data needs preprocessing to handle missing values, normalize features, and ensure it is suitable for training.

## Model Training

Machine learning models are trained using the preprocessed data. Multiple algorithms are explored, and the best-performing model is selected for further evaluation.

## Evaluation

The performance of the trained models is evaluated using various metrics, such as mean absolute error, mean squared error, and R-squared score.

## Results
