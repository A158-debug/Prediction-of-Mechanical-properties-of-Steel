## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/A158-debug/mechanical-properties-prediction.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt` 
3. Explore the codebase and review the documentation. -->

## Data

The dataset used for training and testing the models is already located in the `root` directory. It contains information on material composition and other relevant features.

## Data Preprocessing

Before training the machine learning models, the data needs preprocessing to handle missing values, normalize features, and ensure it is suitable for training.

## Model Training

Machine learning models are trained using the preprocessed data. Multiple algorithms are explored, and the best-performing model is selected for further evaluation.

## Evaluation

The performance of the trained models is evaluated using various metrics, such as mean absolute error, mean squared error, and R-squared score.

## Results

Detailed results and insights gained from the models are documented in this section, providing transparency and allowing for comparisons between different approaches.
